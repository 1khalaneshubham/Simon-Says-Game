# Simon-Says-Game
The players must obey all commands that begin with the words “Simon says”. If Simon says, “Simon says touch your nose” then all players must touch their nose. However, if Simon says, “jump” without saying “Simon says” first the players must not jump. If they do jump, that player is out until the next game.
